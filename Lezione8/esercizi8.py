# Exercise 1: Creating an Abstract Class with Abstract Methods

# Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area and another abstract method perimeter. Then, create two subclasses
# Circle and Rectangle that implement the area and perimeter methods.
# Exercise 2: Implementing Static Methods

# Create a class MathOperations with a static method add that takes two numbers and returns their sum, and another static method 
#multiply that takes two numbers and returns their product.
# Exercise 3: Library Management System 

# Create a Book class containing the following attributes: title, author, isbn
# The book class must contains the following methods:

#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the book.

#     @classmethod from_string(cls, book_str) to create a Book instance from a string in the format "title, author, isbn". 
# It means that you must use the class reference cls to create a new object of the Book class using a string.

# Example: 

# book = “La Divina Commedia, D. Alighieri, 999000666”
# divina_commedia: Book = Book.from_string(book)
# Here divina_commedia must contain an instance of the class Book with 

# title = La Divina Commedia, author = D. Alighieri, isbn = 999000666

# Create a Member class with the following attributes: name, member_id, borrowed_books
# The member class must contain the following methods:

#     borrow_book(book) to add a book to the borrowed_books list.

#     return_book(book) to remove a book from the borrowed_books list.

#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the member.

#     @classmethod from_string(cls, member_str) to create a Member instance from a string in the format "name, member_id".

# Create a Library class with the following attributes: books, members, total_books (class attribute to keep track of the total
# number of books)
# The library class must contain the following methods:

#     add_book(book) to add a book to the library and increment total_books.

#     remove_book(book) to remove a book from the library and decrement total_books.

#     register_member(member) to add a member to the library.

#     lend_book(book, member) to lend a book to a member. It should check if the book is available and if the member is registered.

#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the library with the list of books and members.

#     @classmethod library_statistics(cls) to print the total number of books.

# Create a script and play a bit with the classes:
# Create instances of books and members using class methods. Register members and add books to the library. Lend books to 
# members and display the state of the library before and after lending.

# Exercise 4: University Management System


# Create a system to manage a university with departments, courses, professors, and students. 

# Create an abstract class Person:
# Attributes:

#     name (string)
#     age (int)

# Methods:

#     __init__ method to initialize the attributes.
#     Abstract method get_role to be implemented by subclasses.
#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the person.

# Create subclasses Student and Professor that inherit from Person and implement the abstract methods:

# Student:
# Additional attributes: student_id (string), courses (list of Course instances)
# Method enroll(course) to enroll the student in a course.
# Professor:
# Additional attributes: professor_id (string), department (string), courses (list of Course instances)
# Method assign_to_course(course) to assign the professor to a course.


# Create a class Course:
# Attributes:

#     course_name (string)
#     course_code (string)
#     students (list of Student instances)
#     professor (Professor instance)

# Methods:

#     __init__ method to initialize the attributes.
#     add_student(student) to add a student to the course.
#     set_professor(professor) to set the professor for the course.
#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the course.

# Create a class Department:

# Attributes:

#     department_name (string)
#     courses (list of Course instances)
#     professors (list of Professor instances)


# Methods:

#     __init__ method to initialize the attributes.
#     add_course(course) to add a course to the department.
#     add_professor(professor) to add a professor to the department.
#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the department.

# Create a class University:

# Attributes:

#     name (string)
#     departments (list of Department instances)
#     students (list of Student instances)


# Methods:

#     __init__ method to initialize the attributes.
#     add_department(department) to add a department to the university.
#     add_student(student) to add a student to the university.
#     __str__ method to return a string representation of the university.


# Create a script:

# Create instances of departments, courses, professors, and students.
# Add them to the university.
# Enroll students in courses and assign professors to courses.
# Display the state of the university.
